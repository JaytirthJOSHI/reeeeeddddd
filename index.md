# Reeeeeddddd

Welcome to **Reeeeeddddd** — a delightfully bold, unapologetically red Jekyll UI project.  
This page is here to do one thing: **be red** and **be fun**.

Whether you're just passing by or you're a developer looking for a minimal Jekyll template with some personality, you're in the right place.

## About

### The Color

Let’s not overthink it — it’s **red**.  
Not muted red. Not maroon. Not crimson. Just unapologetically bright, bold, attention-stealing red.

Color psychology? Maybe. Red demands attention.  
**Reeeeeddddd** delivers it.

### The Idea

**Reeeeeddddd** started as a fun experiment — part design playground, part personal challenge.

I wanted to:
- Learn the basics (and quirks) of Jekyll
- Make something absurdly red, just because I could
- Put something out into the world that reflects my love for building with bold choices

What began as a joke turned into a weirdly aesthetic theme that I actually kinda like. Hopefully, you do too.

## FAQ

### What is Reeeeeddddd?

It’s a minimalist Jekyll-based theme with one primary aesthetic: **red**.  
But it’s also:
- A playground for Jekyll beginners
- A fun little statement on simplicity and color
- A great way to learn templating, Markdown, and static sites in general

It doesn’t come with any bloat — just Markdown, layouts, and a whole lot of color. You can fork it, theme it, strip it down, or just admire the redness.

### Why did you make it?

Honestly? For fun.  
Also to:
- Learn more about Jekyll and static site building
- Showcase something that’s visually loud but structurally clean
- Share a simple yet bold starting point for anyone learning web development

Plus, sometimes you just need to make something ridiculous to break out of a creative rut.
